# mazesolving
A variety of  Search Algorithms to solve mazes from an input image. All programs are written in Python. This was just a Project I made to test out my understandings of Search Algorithms learned during the CS 50 course.

## Input
Some example mazes are included in the repository. Others I got from other sources. All mazes needs to ensure that the following rules are followed:

- Each maze is black and white. White represents paths, black represents walls.
- All mazes are surrounded entirely by black walls.
- One white square exists on the top row of the image, and is the start of the maze.
- One white square exists on the bottom row of the image, and is the end of the maze.
